Q) Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution).

Ans) It was a problem with the forecasting of CO2 Emission live dataset.The EDA was the most difficult part of it as it was getting daily update but atlast came up with a permanent solution to it. And the other thing was making it a stationary datset to fitup the ML Model to it.



Q) Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if
V' is a vector space
every element of V′ is also an element of V.
Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of the following is a subspace of V?
The set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
The set of pairs (a, 2a) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b

Ans) The set of pairs (a,b) for all real a >= b
